# Coursera / Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning the Data Project
Assumptions: working directory set to UCI HAR Dataset folder

Run the script run_analysis.R to output a text file containing tidy data:
  1. Training and test sets are merged in one data set
  2. Data contains only mean and standard deviation of each measurement
  3. Activities are changed from numbers to text descriptions
  4. Variable names are labeled
  5. A second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable is created
